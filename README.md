This is the google drive in for the videos that project uses: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Lys4BvZyjYwUTFSYqpE1q8frJwEzR6Lx?usp=drive_link

This is a Digital Museum desktop application in C# .NET using an SQLite Database.
The application simulates a Digital Rock Museum which help the users to get in touch with this kind of music by providing them some information about bands and various other functions.
The application contains 2 user roles and each one has different functionality.

Th goal i wanted to achieve through this project was the experimentation with several kind of multimedia files such as .mp4, .mp3 and .wav files etc, and observe the differences they have.
